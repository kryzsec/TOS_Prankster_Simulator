# TOS_Prankster_Simulator
A suggested TOS role of prankster would be super overpowered.


# Running

This project requires python 3 and takes no command line arguments. This file does not use a config file and thus all edits must occur in the source itself.

# Role Explanation

Each night you visit a person, then you have a 75% chance of pranking them and a 25% chance of killing them. If you successfully prank 3 people you win. [here is the reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TownofSalemgame/comments/ca8o4d/i_hope_no_one_has_made_a_similar_role_idea_if/)
